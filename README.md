# OneClickToProd
One stop app to publish a new version of a web site managed by SVN and hosted on a Linux server

## How it works

1. Connects with SSH on the remote hosting server
2. Does an SVN update at the root of the server
3. Closes the SSH connection
4. (Optional) Creates a tag in the SVN server
5. Updates `configuration` table in the MySQL database to set the `version` field to the SVN revision number

## Configuration

All requested addresses and credentials are customizable in the OneClickToProd.exe.config file.

* `SVNSource` : Address of the SVN server where the project is hosted
* `SVNDestination`: Tag creation destination folder (optional if the `SVNCreateSVNTag` option is not set to `true`)
* `SVNUserName`: The SVN username used to connect
* `SVNCreateSVNTag`: true/false or empty if a tag must be created
* `MySqlHost`: The database host address
* `MySqlUser`: The database username
* `MySqlDatabase`: The database name
* `SSHHost`: The address of the SSH server
* `SSHUser`: The SSH user.

## Application arguments

It's possible to pass arguments to the application. Arguments are build like this config=projectfile

### `config`

The configuration to use in the application excecution. If the new config file is withing the same folder as the application, the path to the file is optional. An empty config file can be found in [base.config](https://github.com/MuffunKevin/OneClickToProd/blob/master/OneClickToProd/base.config).

Sp√©cification: 
* If the file is not valid or its path is wrong, the application will throw an error. 
* If a config parameter is provided, the application won't use the default configuration file to ensure your SVN repositories are safe.

```bash
OneClickToProd.exe config=abc.config
```
